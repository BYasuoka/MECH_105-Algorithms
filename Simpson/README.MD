# Simspon's 1/3 Rule

* This algorithm will take two vector arrays and check to make sure that the x array is equally spaced and that the two arrays are equal in size. If it is not then it will throw an error. 
* It will then check if the trapezoidal rule will be used by dividing the size by 2. If there is no remainder then it will warn the user that the trapezoidal rule will be used. 
* It will then run through the simpson's 1/3 integration equation for the correct amount of iterations. It will compile these values by adding them up in the loop. 
* Once the 1/3 rule is done if the trapezoidal rule needs to be done then it will now do that and add it on to the value. 
* It will then spit out the integration value of your two arrays.
