# Lower-Upper Decomposition (Gauss Elimination) 

* This function will take one matrix input that you want to find the lower, upper, and pivot matrix by using gausse elimination.
* This function has an embedded function at the bottom that aids in rowswapping which takes three inputs, the current version of the matrix and the two rows that want to be swapped. 
* The main function's first test is to see if the matrix is square since this is the one condition of gausee elimination. 
* Afterwards it sorts the matrix so that the largest absolute value of the first column is in the first row. 
* It will then run through the gausse elimination until we are left with the lower, upper, and pivot matrix.
